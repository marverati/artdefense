<h1>How to Play</h1>
<p>This is Art Defense. The game where Tower Defense and Painting come together.</p>
<p>Your goal is to prevent the evil army of floating canvases from reaching the blue tile. Because reasons. 
To do that, you must <b>build towers</b> (or rather.. blobs? Because art style!), which will shoot color at the canvases.
This not only makes the canvases beautiful, it also kills them, saving your valuable blue tile from becoming contaminated.</p>
<p>Note that <b>some canvases come already painted</b> in one solid color. This will prevent your similarly colored blobs from
    attacking, as they know applying red to an already red painting is a huge waste of paint.</p>
<p>To survive in this cruel world, you must not only build new towers, but also <b>upgrade existing ones</b>.</p>
<p>To build and upgrade stuff, you have to use your hand cards, which you see at the bottom of the game screen. Click once to
read, click a second time to use it. For towers and upgrades you then have to place it on the map.
</p>
<h1>Controls</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Mouse to click stuff (that's pretty much it actually)</li>
    <li>P to pause game</li>
    <li>Arrow keys to move view</li>
    <li>1, 2, 3 to vary game speed</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, a few tips and fun facts in case you struggle with beating the game: 
    <ul>
        <li>There is only one level, consisting of 12 waves</li>
        <li>You can build and upgrade stuff whenever you like, not just between waves</li>
        <li>Towers can usually only be upgraded once</li>
        <li>To apply more upgrades to one tower, you need special <i>More Upgrades</i> cards</li>
        <li>Upgrading a single tower multiple times is considered <i>good practice</i> among Art Defense veterans</li>
        <li>If nothing works, feel free to cheat by typing <i>game.deck.drawCard()</i> or <i>game.lives++</i> into your browser console. In doing
            so however, you agree to telling all your friends about how amazing Art Defense is.</li>
        <li>Above this text there's a fancy gallery of all the paintings that made it through. So if you're losing, at least it comes with
            the opportunity to enjoy the art a little longer. Feel free to rightclick and save them or something. Print them and decorate your wall. No?</li>
    </ul>

    I want to thank you very much for playing Art Defense, and hopefully enjoying it to some degree.
    I also want to apologize for the art generated in this game being rather lame. I spent about 4 hours on Saturday trying to
    find a way to physically simulate the effect color blobs have on a canvas when colliding at an angle, and was roughly one 
    math PhD away from figuring it out.
